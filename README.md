# Description
Simple Chrome extension that will allow a user to search for JIRA tickets via the provided toolbar.

## Bonus Features

# Testing
This repository uses the standalone Jasmine installation to load up specs. You can re-run them manually to see results when viewing `/js/jasmine/SpecRunner.html`

* Issue with exporting files, so you'll need to comment that out to run locally.

You can view the coverage summary in the command line when you run `npm run coverage`.
For more information, you can view the the full report under the `coverage/Chrome Headless (version **)/loc-report` directory and search for `index.html`.

All pushes to the master branch will sync the coverage data to code climate.
